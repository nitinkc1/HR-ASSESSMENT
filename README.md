# ü§ñ HR Resource Query Chatbot

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered HR assistant chatbot that helps HR teams quickly find suitable employees. It understands natural language queries about skills, experience, and project history, performs semantic search using a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation) system, and delivers recommendations in a user-friendly chat interface. All AI generation is handled locally with Llama via Ollama, ensuring privacy and offline capability.

---

## Features
- Search employees by skills, experience, project history, and availability  
- Interactive chat interface built with Streamlit, featuring styled message bubbles  
- FastAPI backend with semantic search (RAG) for quick retrieval  
- 30+ realistic employee profiles for testing and demonstration  
- Clear, structured recommendations in natural language  
- Fully local LLM processing with Llama via Ollama (no cloud API required)  
- Customizable frontend appearance (colors, layout, and styling)  
- Advanced prompt engineering for detailed, comparative, and context-aware responses

````

- **Frontend:** Streamlit app for chat with colored UI and responsive message bubbles  
- **Backend:** FastAPI application with endpoints for chat and employee search  
- **RAG Logic:** Embedding-based retrieval using sentence-transformers, combined with local Llama generation for natural responses  
- **Data:** JSON dataset containing 30+ employee profiles

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitinkc1/HR-ASSESSMENT.git
cd HR-ASSESSMENT
````

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install Ollama and Llama model**:

* Download Ollama: [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
* Pull a Llama model:

```bash
ollama pull llama2   # or llama3
```

* Start Ollama:

```bash
ollama run llama2
```

4. **Start the backend**:

## API Documentation

### POST /chat

* **Purpose:** Chat with the HR assistant
* **Request:**

```json
{ "query": "Find Python developers with 3+ years experience" }
```

* **Response:**

```json
{
  "response": "Based on your query, I found 2 suitable candidates...",
  "employees": [ {"id": 1, "name": "Alice Johnson", ...} ]
}
```

### GET /employees/search

* **Purpose:** Search employees by skill, experience, project, or availability
* **Query example:**

```
/employees/search?skill=Python&min_experience=3
```

* **Response:** List of matching employees in JSON

## AI Development Process

* **Tools Used:** ChatGPT, Cursor AI for coding assistance
* **Assistance Provided:**

  * Generating FastAPI and Streamlit boilerplate
  * Debugging errors and dependency issues
  * Structuring project architecture
  * Frontend improvements and chat bubble formatting
  * Prompt design for Llama/Ollama to produce detailed responses
* **AI vs Manual Work:**

  * \~70% AI-assisted for code generation and formatting
  * Manual work for debugging, custom logic, and UI fine-tuning
* **Challenges Solved Manually:** Streamlit session handling, CSS rendering, and multi-attribute ranking

---

## Technical Decisions

* **Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, NumPy, Ollama
* **RAG System:** Local embeddings for fast semantic search; Llama via Ollama for response generation
* **Reason for Local LLM:** Privacy, offline use, no cloud API costs
* **Performance & Privacy:** All data and processing remain local, ensuring security and fast response

---

## Future Improvements

* User authentication and role-based access
* Upload custom employee datasets (CSV/Excel)
* Calendar integration for scheduling
* Advanced LLM responses using different models
* Enhanced UI: avatars, mobile-friendly design, chat bubbles
* AI voice response and analytics dashboard

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure both backend and frontend are running to avoid connection issues
* Ollama must be running and model pulled correctly
* Recommended Python version: 3.10 or 3.11
* If Streamlit UI changes are not applied, refresh browser and restart app

---

## Notes

* Backend uses sentence-transformers for local semantic search (RAG)
* Frontend is Streamlit-based with custom CSS for chat interface and styling

This version keeps the **content original**, avoids plagiarism, and is **ready for your GitHub repository**.  

If you want, I can also **add a ‚ÄúSample Employee Table‚Äù in Markdown** to make it visually appealing for GitHub. Do you want me to do that?
