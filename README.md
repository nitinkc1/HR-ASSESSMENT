# ü§ñ HR Resource Query Chatbot

[![Python]
[![FastAPI]
[![Streamlit]

---

## üìù Overview
The **HR Resource Query Chatbot** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help HR teams find the right employees for projects using natural language processing (NLP) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation) techniques. The system retrieves relevant employee data and generates natural language recommendations.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Natural language query parsing  
- Employee search by skills, experience, and past projects  
- RAG pipeline: Retrieval + Augmentation + Generation  
- Simple chat interface with Streamlit  
- FastAPI backend with async support and automatic documentation  
- Error handling and validation  

---

## üèó Architecture

**Components:**

1. **Data Layer**
   - Sample dataset of 15+ employees  
   - Fields: `name`, `skills`, `experience_years`, `past_projects`, `availability`  

2. **AI/ML Component (RAG System)**
   - Retrieval: Semantic search using embeddings  
   - Augmentation: Combine retrieved profiles with query context  
   - Generation: LLM generates natural language responses  

3. **Backend API**
   - `POST /chat` ‚Äì Chat queries  
   - `GET /employees/search` ‚Äì Search employees by parameters  

4. **Frontend Interface**
   - Streamlit-based chat UI  
   - Clear display of candidate recommendations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitinkc1/HR-ASSESSMENT.git
cd HR-ASSESSMENT
````

2. Create a virtual environment:

```

* Mac/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the FastAPI backend:

```bash

## üõ† AI Development Process

* Tools used: **ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI**
* AI-assisted \~40-50% of code (boilerplate, embeddings setup)
* Manual work: Complex query parsing, candidate ranking, frontend formatting
* Challenges solved manually: Integrating multiple attributes for accurate recommendations

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Technical Decisions

* **OpenAI API** for embeddings and LLM for speed and reliability
* **Streamlit frontend** for easy local deployment
* **FastAPI backend** for async support and automatic docs
* Optional: FAISS for vector search

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements

* Integrate HuggingFace transformers for offline LLM deployment
* Enhanced candidate ranking (availability, project success)
* Multi-language query support
* Calendar/meeting integration for selected employees

---

## üìä Sample Data Structure

```json
{
  "employees": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "skills": ["Python", "React", "AWS"],
      "experience_years": 5,
      "projects": ["E-commerce Platform", "Healthcare Dashboard"],
      "availability": "available"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üéØ Demo

* \[Live Demo Link / Screenshots] ‚Äì Replace with deployed app URL or local setup instructions

---

## üí° Development Tips

* Start with keyword search, then enhance with AI
* Use JSON for quick employee data setup
* Focus on working functionality first, optimize later
* Document AI-assisted process in README

---

## üìÇ Submission

* GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/nitinkc1/HR-ASSESSMENT](https://github.com/nitinkc1/HR-ASSESSMENT)
* Demo link: Add if deployed on Streamlit Cloud or Vercel

```

If you want, I can also make an **even prettier version with tables for employee attributes, flow diagram, and emojis for each section** to make it look professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that next?
